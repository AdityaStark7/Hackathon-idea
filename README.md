      Our Prototype Consists of a face mask detection system andthermal processing to detect fever. We are using highly accuratealgorithms and deep learning methods in this   prototype.You can use this in analyzing around 100 patients at the sametime which really helps our hospital management to skip going through each one and check his/her temperature. It can also use as a system attached to the security camera and check on people who are wearing masks and following rules and who are not.
